# This module provides a FAST (on GPU) content addressable store for storages
# (and tensors on top of them) with VERY WEAK portability guarantees (e.g.,
# don't expect CPU/CUDA to address to the same hash, don't expect it to be
# portable across devices) that is NOT cryptographically secure.  In return,
# we are able to hash 40G of tensor data on GPU in less than a second,
# compared to running SHA-1 in CPU which would a minute or so.  The primary
# use case is for efficiently snapshotting intermediate tensor data for
# offline debugging, but it's been put in this module in case you think of
# another use case for it.  The hash function could be replaced with a
# straight reimplementation of SHA-1, which would give us much stronger
# portability guarantees.
#
# WARNING: THERE IS NO BC/FC GUARANTEE FOR THIS FORMAT!  If you need to format
# shift the result, consider packing it into a single torch.save object
# with traditional view sharing.
#
# Because of the weak portability guarantees, you can only write to the
# content store from a single process; we don't provide any capability
# of "reopening" a content store to add more things to it.  But we don't
# assume that you can keep all of the tensors you want to add to the store
# in memory at once, because you probably can't!  Nor do we assume that
# you know a priori whether or not two storages can be deduplicated or not.
#
# Note: only storages are content-addressed; tensors are name addressed
#
# Note: our padding strategy means that [1, 0] and [1] int16 tensors would
# map to the same (padded) storage.  We think this will be immaterial for most
# users.
